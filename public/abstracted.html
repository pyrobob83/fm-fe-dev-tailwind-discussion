            <ul>
                <li>inside a 'section' that has a BG color (or image) + some vertical padding applied to the section</li>
                <li>container has horizontal padding (px-8) to keep content indented at smaller screens</li>
                <li>container also has it's own vertical padding for vertical space between 'blocks' inside the section</li>
                <li>Result is 2 <em>sets</em> of vertical padding within the overall 'section' above + below the content</li>

            <p>Alternate method that assumes only one 'block' per 'section' - in this scenario all the padding can be on the 'section' so the 'blocks' don't have their own vertical padding and instead the section has double, implemented using the `space-vert-lg` abstraction class.</p>

<section class="bg-gray-200 space-vert-lg !pt-0">
    <div class="block bordered">
        <div class="prose max-w-none">
            <p>In this scenario, we have to explicitly remove the top-padding on the second 'section' to make the two sections seem as one without double-spacing.</p>
            <p>The downside of this method is that you can't ever have two 'blocks' appear to be inside the same section - for example if you wanted a background image on the 'section' but with varying 'blocks' inside of it.</p>
