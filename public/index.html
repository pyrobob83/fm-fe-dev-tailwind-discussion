        This is a default tailwind "container" - all it does is add a max-width at each responsive step. Doesn't include centering the div.

            <p>This is a typical example of a container how I'd normally use it (referred to as a 'block'):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>inside a 'section' that has a BG color (or image) + some vertical padding applied to the section</li>
                <li>container has horizontal padding (px-8) to keep content indented at smaller screens</li>
                <li>container also has it's own vertical padding for vertical space between 'blocks' inside the section</li>
                <li>Result is 2 <em>sets</em> of vertical padding within the overall 'section' above + below the content</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="prose text-white max-w-none">
            <p>This is the second 'block'.  If necessary, the top-padding on this element could be reduced or removed to make the two inner 'blocks' seem more connected.</p>

        <div class="prose text-white max-w-none">
            <p>The benefit of this approach is you can have as many 'blocks' inside the section as necessary, which really shows flexibility when the section has a background image.</p>

            <p>Alternate method that assumes only one 'block' per 'section' - in this scenario all the padding can be on the 'section' so the 'blocks' don't have their own vertical padding and instead the section has double.</p>

<section class="py-8 bg-gray-200 md:py-12 lg:py-16 xl:py-20 2xl:py-24 !pt-0">
    <div class="container px-8 mx-auto border border-gray-500">
        <div class="prose max-w-none">
            <p>In this scenario, we have to explicitly remove the top-padding on the second 'section' to make the two sections seem as one without double-spacing.</p>
            <p>The downside of this method is that you can't ever have two 'blocks' appear to be inside the same section - for example if you wanted a background image on the 'section' but with varying 'blocks' inside of it.</p>
